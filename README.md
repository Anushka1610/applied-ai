# applied-ai
Collection of DL/ML models for a graduate Applied AI course. Most come with a Jupyter notebook and associated Python script.

Some code taken from / inspired by [Fran√ßois](https://github.com/fchollet/deep-learning-with-python-notebooks), and a lot of knowledge gained from [Goodfellow, Bengio and Courville](https://www.deeplearningbook.org/).
